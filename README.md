# Description

This is a very simple text editor app that allows you to type in a text box and save the text to a database. The app uses a service worker to cache the app and allows it to be downloaded and used offline. The app also uses indexedDB to store the data and then upload it to the database when the app is back online.

See User Story below for more details.
